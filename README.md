SynTexAnalyze is an open-source Python library for analyzing synchrotron X-ray-based texture data.
The package is currently under development and will go public after the original paper has been published.

Will also add the capability of process data generated at 11 ID-C and 1 ID-E

Might be able to process the HEDM data or interact with MADIAS in the future to obtain HEDM results. 

For Data processing, might use GPU based processing or Cpython to increase the speed.
